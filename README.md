The Odin Project | Foundations Course | Recipe Project

This is a project in The Odin Project's Foundations Course.
In this project I will be building a basic html recipe site using the HTML knowledge I have acquired thus far. 

This website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

This project will be revisited in the future to add styling with CSS
