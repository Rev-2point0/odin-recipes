    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This baked mac and cheese is a family favorite recipe, loved by both children and adults. It uses a combination of cheeses, layered in the dish as well as melted into a rich and creamy cheese sauce, for the ultimate in cheesy deliciousness!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. dried elbow pasta</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups half and half **see chef tips #1 below**</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded medium cheddar cheese divided (measured after shredding)</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Gruyere cheese divided (measured after shredding)</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp. salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. paprika smoked paprika is our favorite!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
   <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and grease a 3 qt baking dish (9x13"). Set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. When boiling, add dried pasta and cook 1 minute less than the package directs for al dente. Drain and drizzle with a little bit of olive oil to keep from sticking.</li>
        <li>While water is coming up to a boil, grate cheeses and toss together to mix, then divide into three piles. Approximately 3 cups for the sauce and 1 cup for the topping.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over MED heat. Sprinkle in flour and whisk to combine. Mixture will look like very wet sand. Cook for approximately 1 minute, whisking often. Slowly pour in about 2 cups or so of the milk/half and half, while whisking constantly, until smooth. Slowly pour in the remaining milk/half and half, while whisking constantly, until combined and smooth.</li>
        <li>Continue to heat over MED heat, whisking constantly until the sauce thickens. It should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and stir in spices and 3 cups of cheeses until smooth.</li>
        <li>Stir in drained pasta until completely coated. Pour half of the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Top with 1 cup of cheese and then top with the remaining pasta mixture.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the last cup of cheese over the top and bake for 15 minutes, until cheese is melted and bubbly. Broil for a minute or so at the end to make the cheese perfectly golden on top.</li>
        <li>Let sit for a few minutes before serving.</li>
